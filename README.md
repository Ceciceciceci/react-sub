Hello Craig and Zendesk team,

Thank you for taking a look at the project. There are two folders in this project: client and api. To run the project, please have two terminals open, one redirected into the client folder and one into the api folder. After that, run npm start on the api folder and then npm start on the client folder. 

The file in the api folder for the server is server.js.  The client folder inside src, contains Form.js which is where the form resides.  I've included the node_modules files for both just in case, but if a library seems to be missing please npm install for both folders api and client. 

This project was build using React, SASS, and Express/Node.
