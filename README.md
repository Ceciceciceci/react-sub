Hello Craig and Zendesk team,

Thank you for taking a look at the project. There are two folders in this project: client and api. 

UPDATE: The client and api folder currently does not have the node modules file and I am also not able to push this folder for some reason to Github even though Github has says that it has pushed the folder. 
To run the project, please have two terminals open, one redirected into the client folder and one into the api folder. 
1.) Run npm install on both folders. The package.json file includes everything needed to run the project.
2.) After that, run npm start on the api folder first and then npm start on the client folder after. 

The file in the api folder for the json/server is server.js.  The client folder inside src, contains Form.js which is where the subscription form resides.  
This project was built using React, SASS, and Express/Node. 

 - Cecilia
